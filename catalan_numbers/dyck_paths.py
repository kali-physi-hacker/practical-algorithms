Catalan numbers
---------------
Catalan numbers are a sequence of positive integers that are found in many counting problems in combinatorics.
They count certain  types of:
- lattice paths
- permutations
- binary trees
- other combinatorial objects
They satisfy a fundamental recurrence relation, and have a closed-form formula in terms of binomial coefficients.

Definition
---------
C0, C1, C2, ... Cn, ... are given by the forumla:
Cn = (1/(n+1))(2n/n)
=> C0 = 1
=> C1 = 1
=> C2 = 2
=> C3 = 5
=> C4 = 14
=> C5 = 42
