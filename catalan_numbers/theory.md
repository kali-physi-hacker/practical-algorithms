# Catalan Numbers
Catalan numbers are a sequence of positive integers that are found in many counting problems in combinatorics.   
They count certain  types of:   
- lattice paths
- permutations
- binary trees
- other combinatorial objects

They satisfy a fundamental recurrence relation, and have a closed-form formula in terms of binomial coefficients.

## Definition
C<sub>0</sub>, C<sub>1</sub>, C<sub>2</sub>, ..., C<sub>n</sub> are given by the formula   
C<sub>n</sub> = $\frac{1}{n+1}$($\frac{2n}{n}$)
